## Exercises

First steps
Open your browser and go to https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/. 
Have a first look around. Find out what missions and services are.


Exercise 1 - Embark on your first mission
Go to https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/ and open the “Mission Catalog”. 
Search for the mission “Getting Started with Discovery Center Missions”. Open it and start the mission. 
You will need to log on to start it. 
If you don’t have a user go to https://www.sap.com/ and create your user.

and follow the instructions on the next card until you have completed all cards.

Congratulations – you have now completed your first mission.



Exercise 2 – Get started with SAP BTP

Now it is time to prepare SAP Business Technology Platform and use it.
Again go to https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/ and open the “Mission Catalog”. 
Search for the mission “Getting Started with SAP BTP Enterprise Account”. Open and start the mission. 
Again, go through the cards of the project board ad follow the instructions until you have completed the mission. 
In this mission your learned for your SAP BTP Enterprise Account how to assign assigning global administrators, creating subaccounts, checking your entitlements, assigning quotas, and start leveraging your SAP BTP Services. To makes this easier and faster SAP is now offering the Quick Account Setup (QAS) for many missions. This QAS automates the key steps for you so, that you can directly start using the BTP service(s) required for your specific use case.
Still we recommend to run through the “Getting Started with SAP BTP Enterprise Account” mission to get a good understanding of what the QAS will do for you.



Exercise 3 – Pick your next mission

After you learned how to use the SAP Discovery Center and got started with SAP BTP enterprise accounts it is time to pick your own mission.
There are typical 2 ways which we observed how innovation is being driven:
a)	use case centered,
b)	technology driven.

Please explore both ways by 
a)	browse the Mission Catalog and try the various filter and search options to find your next mission
b)	browse the Service Catalog to explore the technical services SAP BTP offers. Try the various filter and search options to find one or more services. 
    Or browse the Reference Architectures Catalog to find out  which use cases you can realize in your current or planned landscape. 

Check the “Related Missions” to find your next mission.
